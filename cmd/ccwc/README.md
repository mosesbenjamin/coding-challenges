### The Challenge - Building wc

[x] - write a simple version of wc, lets call it ccwc (cc for Coding Challenges) that takes the command line option -c and outputs the number of bytes in a file.
[x] - support the command line option -l that outputs the number of lines in a file.
[x] - support the command line option -w that outputs the number of words in a file.
[x] - support the command line option -m that outputs the number of characters in a file
[x] - support the default option - i.e. no options are provided, which is the equivalent to the -c, -l and -w options
[ ] - support being able to read from standard input if no filename is specified.
